Yes, we’re living in a society where having a great physique has become a necessity and with this we may have completely lost the understanding of the word ‘Fitness’.  Most of us work out because someone made an in-appropriate comment on our appearance or pretty much mainly because we’re trying to fit in this society. We’ve become so aware of how we look. It’s become all about the appearance! There’s no shame in that! If I was to state 3 reasons as to why I work out, Health would probably come in third. Having that great physique being first. Most of us can relate to this.  Here’s the thing though, for whatever reason you were working out, with or without your knowledge, YOU still touched on that ‘health’ part. For whatever reason you went to the gym, YOU had the correct mindset to start and finish your session. Do you realize just how strong you are? So! SCULPT IN THE NAME OF WHATEVER! You’re still getting the job done.

We all want to know how to be healthy, but it seems like such a lofty goal. Setting out to make healthy lifestyle changes can feel simultaneously inspiring and intimidating. I mean, where do you even start? Do you need to overhaul your entire life in one fell swoop? The answer, you may be happy to know, is: no. When it comes to adopting new healthy habits and making them stick, there are lots of little things you can do that will make a big difference in the long run (and not make you crazy in the process). Instead of trying to upgrade your health with a huge makeover, try these nine small, practically painless moves instead for long-lasting results.

1. Plate your meals backward.
People often pile on the carbs, then mosey on over to the protein, then top it all off with a meager scoop of vegetables in whatever space is left. Instead, go in reverse order, Evans Murugi, R.D., our nutritionist, tells us: Fill half your plate with vegetables, then divide the remaining quarters between protein and a starch, ideally something made up of complex carbohydrates instead of refined ones, like brown rice.

Serving yourself this way helps ensure you’re getting your recommended daily servings of vegetables (at least 2 ½ cups, says the USDA), plus it increases your fiber intake and hydration levels thanks to vegetables’ water content.

2. Put your food away when you’re done serving yourself.
“Anyone will eat more if the food is staring at them,” Murugi says. Always feel free to grab more if you’re truly hungry, but this way, you’ll know it’s because of a physical need for more food instead of pure convenience or temptation.

3. Drink a glass of water before each meal.
Drinking the amount of water you need each day is necessary for all of your body’s systems to function smoothly, but it will also keep you from overeating due to hunger, making it easier to take a more mindful approach to your meals, Langer says.

4. To double down on the mindfulness, chew each bite thoroughly before swallowing.
The “reasons you need to slow your roll when eating” list is about as long as your arm, Langer explains. Wolfing down food can lead to bloating because of the extra air you’re swallowing, that way-too-full feeling because you don’t give your body a chance to process satiety before you clean your plate, and completely missing out on how delicious the food actually is.
